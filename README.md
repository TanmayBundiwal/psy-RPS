# psy-RPS
A collection of 2 very simple terminal based python games. 

Aim: Test an algorithm developed by my friend for Rock Paper and Scissors game. 

File Description:  
RPS.py      : A regular Rock, Paper and Scissors game that uses random module.  
RPSRatna.py : A modified version of Rock, Paper and Scissors game where the computer uses the algorithm suggested by my friend.

Ideally, you should score less while playing RPSRatna.

Try 'em out and see if my friend hacked into your brain!
